# Holdable Token

This is the work in progress implementation of [EIP Holdable Token](https://github.com/IoBuilders/EIPs/blob/eip-holdable-token/EIPS/eip-holdable-token.md). This implementation will change over time with the token standard and is not stable at the moment.

Feedback is appreciated and can given at [the discussion of the EIP](https://github.com/IoBuilders/EIPs/pull/1).
